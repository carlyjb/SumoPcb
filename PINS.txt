Serial port: directly connected to the Trinket. You can initialize hardware serial on these pins for debugging, or use them as digital-only GPIO.

Analog/digital pins: directly connected to the Trinket. A5 can be either analog input or digital I/O; A6 is _only_ an analog input. AREF is the reference voltage for analog inputs.
